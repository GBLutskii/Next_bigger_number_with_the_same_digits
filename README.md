# Next_bigger_number_with_the_same_digits
 
Some challenge from Codewars (read more https://www.codewars.com/kata/55983863da40caa2c900004e/csharp)

Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits. For example: 12 ==> 21; 513 ==> 531; 2017 ==> 2071;

If the digits can't be rearranged to form a bigger number, return -1: 9 ==> -1; 111 ==> -1; 531 ==> -1;

P.S.: You may paste the code from class next_bigger_number_with_the_same_digits to check it on codewars.com or run the Program.cs with attached class to check it on your PC with your own test strings.
